Hey welcome to my site! Currently, the site is based on a ***heavily modified*** version of [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/). Hugo-Book was designed for documentation, and I have many substantial changes to the repo (and removed many things) to make it suitable for a beautiful blog.
