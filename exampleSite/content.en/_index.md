- ## What Hugo-Book Theme Is
  Hugo book theme is primarily designed to create technical documentation sites that are easy to read, write, navigate and maintain. It is an attempt to create a sustainable web project.

- ## What Hugo-Book Theme Is Not
  Book theme is not trying to implement all features but to create a starting point. It is mostly feature complete and gets updated and improved to stay relevant with Hugo and modern web.

  ### Even more
  Do people actually read these? I thought it was just a visual filler. But there is full-text search and multi-language support.
