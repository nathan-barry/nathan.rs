## Nathan Barry

I am a Computer Science masters student at UT Austin. I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics at UT Austin for undergrad. I was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri. I started programming in 2017 my freshman year of high school, with Python and JavaScript, serving PyTorch models with Flask and React. Now (some 8+ years later) I'm focused on machine learning and low-level systems.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, biking, playing ultimate frisbee, bowling, and [reading](/posts/favorite-books/). People have described me as smart, hard-working, conscientious, and a tiny bit eccentric. Below is a normal photo of me my senior year of high school (I more or less look the exact same since then).
