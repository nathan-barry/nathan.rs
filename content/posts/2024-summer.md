### Reflections
I had an alright summer. Read plenty of books, learned Go really well, learned more about C and C++, got pretty good at Leetcode, and did a bunch of other small things. Nothing too exciting or great, just another stretch of time of me doing things I should do and learning things I should learn. Chipping away at the stone some more.
