I found myself walking outside and staring at the leaves. I tend to walk when I am lost in thought, a too-common occurance. Usually, I walk in a circle in whatever room I find myself to occupy. I mindlessly stare at the floor, automatically and unconsciously moving one foot after another.

Something in my conscience likes stepping on patterns. Generally, it is where the ends of the wooden boards of the floor meet, randomly peppering the floor with a cornucopia of lines which my feet follow. If the floor consists of square tiles, I might move around like a knight in chess, moving only 2 tiles up and one to the side on each step. This time, I was stepping on the scattered leaves of the winter ground.

The thought eventually crossed my head that I must look ridiculous. To someone on the outside, it appears as if Iâ€™m stumbling forward like a drunkard with no rhyme or reason, or as if I were a stochastic random walk, weighted to favor one direction. To me though, everything made sense. One leaf to the next, like a frog jumping from lilypad to lilypad.

It dawned on me how within this kernel of thought held a very human archetype: the outside and the inside, the strange and the familiar, of chaos and order, to be known or misunderstood. How often there are barriers between people that make each look incomprehensible to another. Like all human archetypes, it spoke to me; it is what it means to endure the human experience. My mind moved on as I stepped on the next leaf.
