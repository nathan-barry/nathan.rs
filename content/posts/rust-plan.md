I'm currently in an uninspired slump. Everything in my life is actually going pretty great, it's just that I currently don't have any project or idea that is occupying my mind. I spend my days with too much time on my hand, wishing for something to work on. I think I'll get back to learning rust again. I remember the first time I went through the rust book was in high school, and the second time was freshman year. It is my senior year and I plan to go through it again. However though, now I am much more ambitious with the things I plan to do. Here are some of those things below:

First:

{{% unchecked %}} Rustlings {{% /unchecked %}}

Potential ideas:

{{% unchecked %}} Rust monolithic kernel {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Rust WASM runtime {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Rust open source {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Rust LLM from scratch with quantization (Microsoft CPU paper?) {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Rust Quantum Computing language interpreter {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Rust WASM in-browser fractal renderer {{% /unchecked %}}

{{% unchecked %}} Rust static site generator (redo my website) {{% /unchecked %}}
{{% unchecked %}} Haskel interpreter {{% /unchecked %}}
