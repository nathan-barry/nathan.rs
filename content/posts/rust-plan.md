I'm currently in an uninspired slump. I think I'll get back to learning rust again. I remember the first time I went through the rust book was in high school, and the second time was freshman year. It is my senior year and I plan to go through it again. However though, now I am much more ambitious with the things I plan to do. Here are some of those things below:
