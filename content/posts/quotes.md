"I believe that a man should strive for only one thing in life, and that is to have a touch of greatness"
<br>— Félix Martí-Ibáñez

"A happy programmer is one who is neither underutilized nor weight down with ill-formulated goals and stressful process friction."
<br>— Eric Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar

“The march of Providence is so slow and our desires so impatient; the work of progress so immense and our means of aiding it so feeble; the life of humanity is so long, that of the individual so brief, that we often see only the ebb of the advancing wave and are thus discouraged. It is history that teaches us to hope.”
<br>― Robert E. Lee

"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals."
<br>― C.S. Lewis 

"But you see," said Roark quietly, "I have, let's say, sixty years to live. Most of that time will be spent working. I've chosen the work I want to do. If I find no joy in it, then I'm only condemning myself to sixty years of torture. And I can find the joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me. But the best is a matter of standards—and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one."
<br>― Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead

"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars"
<br>― Kahlil Gibran

"We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies—all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.”
<br>― Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception

"I have often felt that programming is an art form,
whose real value can only be appreciated
by another versed in the same arcane art;
there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,
by the very nature of the process.
You can learn a lot about an individual
just by reading through his code,
even in hexadecimal.
Mel was, I think, an unsung genius."
<br>― Ed Nather, The Story of Mel, Appendix A. Hacker Folklore

"C++ is a hammer, but then everything starts to look like your finger"
<br>— textlapse, hackernews user

"What you seek is seeking you"
<br>— Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī

"No matter how isolated you are and how lonely you feel, if you do your work truly and conscientiously, unknown friends will come and seek you."
<br>— Carl Jung

"The truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do."
<br>— Ursula K. Le Guin

"The thoughts of others\
Were light and fleeting,\
Of lovers' meeting\
Or luck or fame.\
Mine were of trouble,\
And mine were steady;\
So I was ready\
When trouble came.”
<br>— A.E. Housman

“I used to analyze myself down to the last thread, used to compare myself with others, recalled all the smallest glances, smiles and words of those to whom I’d tried to be frank, interpreted everything in a bad light, laughed viciously at my attempts ‘to be like the rest’ –and suddenly, in the midst of my laughing, I’d give way to sadness, fall into ludicrous despondency and once again start the whole process all over again – in short, I went round and round like a squirrel on a wheel.”
<br>— Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment

“The day a blind man sees, the first thing he throws away is the stick that has helped him all his life”
<br>— Unknown

“Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad"
<br>— Herman Melville, Moby Dick

"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our thoughts"
<br>— Charles Darwin
