<p style="white-space: pre-line">
Here we all are, this mountain we climb,
the sure ascent, that lasts a lifetime,
at the golden summit, a goal we all seek
the meaning of life, at its Godly peak.

Up we should go, a noble direction.
Yet why do so many, rebel in rejection
Up is worthwhile, this mountain we climb,
at the apex is all that’s sublime.

Choose anything else and you will regret
not doing the work and how upset
you’ll find yourself years down the line
when fate and destiny don’t align.

It’s steep and mighty, this mountain we climb.
A difficult ascent, with wrong paradigms.
Nothing worth doing is ever so easy
so build yourself up and try to think deeply.

Who and what and where and why
am I on this earth so full and alive?
One must be wise, of an earnest heart
before one can begin our mortal march.

We each have God’s purpose we must see unspun,
and one must start now, else time will be done.
You'll find yourself old before you’ve begun
with the great song of life, never to be sung.

So hurry now, and climb this mountain,
when ye still blessed a youthful fountain.
Honorably embrace the peaks, the valleys,
before you’re condemned to go down death’s alley.
