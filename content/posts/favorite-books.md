    description="This book is about the FTX collapse and is a short and enjoyable read. It was a very interesting book to listen to, especially as someone who was interested and working at DeFi startups at the time. That year itself was just absolutely wild. Beanstalk, Terra, FTX, and all the hacks that happened, things blowing up left and right. Seeing the outcome of an overleveraged market imploding on itself, combined with the outcome of dozens of bad (irrational) decisions. What is most wild about this story is just how fine FTX was. They were making half a billion a year in profits. The only reason why FTX went insolvent was because they illegally backdoored their own customer funds to Alameda Research. Most people working there when things started to collapse were in absolute disbelief that they were insolvent, since they were literally operating a money printer.">}}

{{< book
    title="Seeing Like A State"
    author="James C. Scott"
    special=""
    description="This book talks about how authoritarianism and high modernist movements have always failed because of the human tendency to abstract away concrete minute details for uniformity and simplicity. For any system that we desire to have more control over, we force it to adhere to our abstractions and shape systems to be more legible, which has had extreme successes and failures throughout the industrial world. One thing that I have pondered about in the past is whether authoritarianism ever could work. In theory, if we had a perfect omnipotent being that knew all, it should be able to devise a more perfect and efficient system than what free market forces could devise, since there is no information delay or imperfections. Perhaps in a world with the extensive data mining and tracking we have today, the Soviets would have fared much better. To the hypothetical idea of creating an AI that can plan and direct economies, I wonder if it is feasible or whether there will always be detrimental edge cases that the model doesn't generalize well on. Regardless, it'll be as heartless as any state has been when it comes to realities that it does not considers.">}}

    description="I've read plenty of books about the history of technology and silicon valley, but this one has been by far the most extensive and complete. One beauty of learning things is that you see how many things are connected. This book added on to that. For instance, I already knew about the history of Fairchild Semiconductor, but I somehow missed the huge connection that Noyce also founded Intel as well. What a glaring gap in my knowledge now resolved. I liked the chronological order of this book, from Babbage to modern day, as a lot of these stories that I've heard were individual instances and this book showed the connections from the flow of time.">}}

{{< book
    title="Industrial Society And Its Future"
    author="Ted Kaczynski"
    special=""
    description="This is a very interesting book which covers a broad set of ideas similar to Seeing Like A State, Huxley's Brave New World, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and Bostrom's Superintelligence. Most of his commentary on contemporary society is true (especially interesting is his commentary on the insatiable character of left-wing movements) but the conclusion he draws is bizarre. Yes, technology is great, it has reduced the burden of man and has drastically increased the quality of life for billions of people. It has also alienated man from their natural state, caused mass societal and environmental problems, and has arguably reduced humans to gears in a system, with that system restricting freedom and turning out lives Kafkaesque with rules imposed on us and our individuality consistently stripped away. However, the solution is to not eradicate 95% of the human race and nuke us back to the Stone Age, as his solution must inevitably cause. If mankind has shown one specialty, it is innovating and having the capabilities to dig itself out of its own holes it inevitably creates by the unintended side effects of progress. Progress is just the motif of humanity and trying to create a world where it is limited is a fools errand, even if it wasn't a terrible idea from the offset. One striking curiosity is how the anti-human Unabomber worldview has become fashionable amongst those exact same over-socialized elites Kaczynski laments about in his work. Hopefully, the future will shine fortune on those who want to take humanity to the stars than those who desire to revert it to the yesteryears wherein for most of man, life is nasty, brutish, and short.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Cathedral & The Bazaar"
    author="Eric S. Raymond"
    special=""
    description="One thing that I thought was interesting in this book was it's discussion on the origin of traditions and customs for conflict resolution management in a decentralized system where there is no central authority. I've recently been thinking about that topic as a whole when applied to the history of the United States (and societies in general), and how such tradition and customs (deemed legitimate by the host population) were the foundations of order, and how when central authority monopolized dispensing of justice, such traditions and customs completely faded. Such things tend to completely die, with people domesticated, and left completely reliant on the central authority to properly uphold law and order, which for a variety of states across time, tends to be improperly implemented. Overall, I think that the book was very interesting and covered insightful history on the birth of the open source movement.">}}

I'd rather use something like Zig and Rust, where making it deployable seems like a sane task.

Because the Morgan Dynasty has been around for 200 years, this book also is nearly a history of modern banking as a whole.

People that build monuments have enough trust that there will be someone there in the future to remember them. Very few monuments were built after the early life of the empire, which also lines up with the start of its decline. Of course, economic factors play in, but maybe people didn't believe that future generations would be there for them? Or at least future generations that they cared about." >}}

Every time I think about it, focusing my entire life on gathering resources and then pivoting all my focus on my future kids seems like it should surely have a higher long term expected value than me trying to reach great heights, as my kids would surely be able to do more.

I'm always reminded how, in response to the criticism of conspiracy theories in general, people remind us that the founding of our country was a massive conspiracy theory. The more I exist, the more I realize that a lot of the largest socio, political, and economic events in human history have all been just strings of conspiracy theories, and we are almost certainly living amongst many at the current moment." >}}

After reading books about Bechtel and McKinsey and seeing how those companies had a large impact on Enron and how it all feeds one another, one realizes what a complicated beast humanity is. I also just thought it's interesting seeing how historically, periods of exuberance come again and again and how our window of pattern recognition is far smaller than how often these periods occur. Problems are always ignored when the momentum of things are positive and it is only until the floor from under us begins to shake that we realize our folly.

    description="I think that this is an important book for everyone to read. I disagreed with a lot of things and the book is very heavily biased, but as Zinn points out himself, it is to give the counterview of the majority of mainstream history.">}}

    author="James Dale Davidson & William Rees-Mogg"

    description="There seems to be a trend in human history where new innovations start under a centralized institution. The internet and dozens of other innovations under the U.S. Military. Literateness used to be solely for the royal and religious sectors of society. Civilization itself, under the Egyptians, Babylonians, etc, started under a centralized power structure. As society progresses, such innovations trickle down from centralized institutions down to individuals. This book talks a lot about this past trend and tries to predict future trends from it, and most of the predictions have held out quite well.">}}

    description="I've seen this book here and there for years but didn't have any idea of what it was until I finally checked it out. This is apparently the original redpill manifesto. I don't agree with this life philosophy, but I do think it does has a lot of things any young guy should be conscious of. I certainly disagree with the nihilistic hypergamous view of cross-gender relations. Underneath the 'toxic masculinity' dressing, the book just vouches for good habits and that one should look inwards for validation instead of from the people around us.">}}

I do enjoy the talks about morality and philosophy. I've listened to the majority of content he had produced up to 2020 and have found much of the new to be a rehash of the old. I saw him give a lecture in Austin, his first public tour in a couple of years. It was all stuff I've already heard him say in the hundreds of hours I've listened to him. I feel like that's how this book felt to me.">}}

It was the fact that your habits reinforce your identity and your identity reinforces your habits. If you wake up early, you probably identify as a morning person. Because you identify as a morning person, there's much less cognitive friction in waking up early. It's just *who you are*. It's just *what you do*. Anytime I want to make a positive change in my life, I try to just become someone that does that. I want to get good at math? I'll just dive into it and *become a math guy*. Goes for anything.">}}

It's fascinating because these stories always delve into the minds of men who were thrown into unthinkable circumstances but who are quite relatable. WW2 and every war before seems as if it is from a distant time, but Vietnam, it is actually comprehensible how we went from there to now.">}}
