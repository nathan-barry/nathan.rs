{{< book
    title="Willpower"
    author="Roy F. Baumeister & John Tierney"
    special=""
    description="I was at a ZFellows event in SF where one of the speakers, Adam Guild, recommended this book. It's been a long time since I've read a self-help book like this. I gave it a shot because I've felt lazy recently and was looking for something to help me pick up my old good habits again. EDIT: I did start waking up early again, there has been a directional shift.">}}

{{< book
    title="Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China"
    author="Ezra F. Vogel"
    special="true"
    description="I honestly had no idea how much knowledge I lacked over contemporary Chinese history and politics until after reading this. This makes me give the neo-liberalists some more slack since it really did seem like China was liberalizing after the sino-soviet split and the opening of China to western markets. Deng was flying a large ship through a tight alleyway. Starting China's rapid economic development while maintaining a strong grip over the country, especially when the Soviet Union was collapsing in on itself, is a testament to the keen leadership he provided while at the helm.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Metamorphosis"
    author="Franz Kafka"
    special=""
    description="I recently woke up sick one day and it was so bad that it made me read this book. I didn't like it.">}}

{{< book
    title="Super Pumped"
    author="Mike Isaac"
    special=""
    description="This is a story about the founding of Uber and of Travis Kalanick. I was completely unaware of all the drama around Uber that happened in 2017. Really just a hurricane of unfortunate events (many of which were self-inflicted) which crashed into them all at once.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Soul of a New Machine"
    author="Tracy Kidder"
    special="true"
    description="This book came out in 1981 and covered the creation of a Data General Eclipse machine. I think it does a good job at portraying the heroic in the lives we all live. The longer I exist, the more it is reinforced that in life, the proper objective function to optimize is that of adventure.">}}

{{< book
    title="The World For Sale"
    author="Javier Blas & Jack Farchy"
    special=""
    description="This was a really good book over the history of commodity trading. Commodity traders have wielded immense influence over world events in the past century and little was known about them until the last couple of decades. They went wherever money could be made. Didn't matter if they were allowing states to evade sanctions, propping up dictators, bribing politicians, or funding rebels, if they could make a buck they were there. Super interesting book.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Innovator's Dilemma"
    author="Clayton M. Christensen"
    special="true"
    description="I've always knew about this book but didn't read it until I read that it heavily influenced Jensen on how he ran Nvidia. This book actually really was good and has changed how I look at companies and their new initiatives. Very insightful. Also reminded me of Asianometry since I've watched multiple of his videos on the disk drive industry (which probably took a lot from this book).">}}

{{< book
    title="All Systems Red"
    author="Martha Wells"
    special=""
    description="I had to read this for a class. It's pretty decent and is a fast read. I've never read sci-fi that much (as you can see below) but this book was pretty palatable.">}}

{{< book
    title="No Rules Rules"
    author="Reed Hastings & Erin Meyer"
    special=""
    description="This book is about Netflix. It's more similar to the book 'How Google Works' in that it's not a history of the company, but more of a description of the company culture. It's moderately interesting. Doesn't mean much to me now but might later.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Nvidia Way"
    author="Tae Kim"
    special="true"
    description="A great book about the start of Nvidia. Honestly seems like a great company to work at. High standards, flat structure, collaborative culture, and smart hardworking people. Fantastic vision from leadership (Jensen), predicting the rise of general purpose GPU programming (with CUDA) and the importance of machine learning. One step ahead for 30 years.">}}

{{< book
    title="An Introduction to Linear Algebra"
    author="Gilbert Strang"
    special=""
    description="I went back through this textbook and took notes over it. I like having notes over 'core' math like this that I can go back to time to time. Most of my classes this semester is heavy with linear algebra, so I thought it would be good to refresh my memory.">}}

{{< book
    title="When Einstein Walked with Gödel"
    author="Jim Holt"
    special=""
    description="This was an interesting book covering wide ranging topics over mathematics and philosophy: graph theory, quantum physics, string theory, history, etc. It reminds me of the two books Quantum Magazine has published in the sense where it's made up of a series of disjoint topics over a variety of topics.">}}

{{< book
    title="The C Programming Language"
    author="Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie"
    special=""
    description="This is the third time I've picked up this book. The first time was when I first entered Computer Architecture and read about the first 50 pages. I'm thinking that I might do a lot of C development, and I always prefer to read everything about a language if I'm going to use it a lot. There's always nuggets you find here and there.">}}

{{< book
    title="Competitive Programmer's Handbook"
    author="Antti Laaksonen"
    special=""
    description="Read the first two thirds and skimmed the last third (about misc. topics). It was a good review of my Algorithms & Complexity class, as it covers many of the same algorithms.">}}

{{< book
    title="Going Infinite"
    author="Michael Lewis"
    special="true"
    description="This book is about the FTX collapse. That period of time was just absolutely crazy. FTX, Terra, all the hacks that happened, things blowing up left and right, etc. What is most wild about this story is just how fine FTX was. They were making half a billion a year in profits. The only reason why FTX went insolvent was because they illegally backdoored their own customer funds to Alameda Research. Most people working there when things started to collapse were in absolute disbelief that they were insolvent, since they were literally operating a money printer.">}}

{{< book
    title="Seeing Like A State"
    author="James C. Scott"
    special="true"
    description="This book talks about how authoritarianism and high modernist movements have always failed because of the human tendency to abstract away concrete minute details for uniformity and simplicity. For any system that we desire to have more control over, we force it to adhere to our abstractions and shape systems to be more legible, which has had extreme successes and failures throughout the industrial world. One thing that I have pondered about in the past is whether authoritarianism ever could work. In theory, if we had a perfect omnipotent being that knew all, it should be able to devise a more perfect and efficient system than what free market forces could devise, since there is no information delay or imperfections. Perhaps in a world with the extensive data mining and tracking we have today, the Soviets would have fared much better. To the hypothetical idea of creating an AI that can plan and direct economies, I wonder if it is feasible or whether there will always be some critical component missing. Regardless, it'll be as heartless as any state when it comes to realities that it does not considers.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Innovators"
    author="Walter Isaacson"
    special=""
    description="I've read plenty of books about the history of technology and silicon valley, but this one has been by far the most extensive and complete. One beauty of learning things is that you see how many things are connected. This book added on to that. For instance, I already knew about the history of Fairchild Semiconductor, but I somehow missed the huge connection that Noyce also founded Intel as well. What a glaring gap in my knowledge now resolved. I liked the chronological order of this book, from Babbage to modern day, as a lot of these stories that I've heard were individual instances and this book showed the connections across the flow of time.">}}

{{< book
    title="Industrial Society And Its Future"
    author="Ted Kaczynski"
    special=""
    description="This is a very interesting book which covers a broad set of ideas similar to Seeing Like A State, Huxley's Brave New World, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and Bostrom's Superintelligence. Most of his commentary on contemporary society is true, but the conclusion he draws is just wrong. Yes, technology is great, it has reduced the burden of man and has drastically increased the quality of life for billions of people. Yes, it has also alienated man from their natural state, caused mass societal and environmental problems, and has arguably reduced humans to gears in a system, with that system restricting freedom and turning out lives Kafkaesque with rules imposed on us and our individuality consistently stripped away. The solution is to not eradicate 95% of the human race and nuke us back to the Stone Age, as his solution must inevitably cause. If mankind has shown one specialty, it is innovating and having the capabilities to dig itself out of its own holes it inevitably creates by the unintended side effects of progress. One striking curiosity is how the anti-human and anti-growth Unabomber worldview has become fashionable amongst those exact same over-socialized elites Kaczynski laments about in his work. Hopefully, the future will shine fortune on those who want to take humanity to the stars than those who desire to revert it to the yesteryears wherein life was nasty, brutish, and short.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Founders"
    author="Jimmy Soni"
    special="true"
    description="This was a good book that covered the history of PayPal and all the members that eventually became known as the PayPal Mafia. This got the special blue tag because of the last chapter. That was completely out of left field and pushed this book over the edge. This guy also wrote the Claude Shannon book below, great author in general.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Cathedral & The Bazaar"
    author="Eric S. Raymond"
    special=""
    description="One thing that I thought was interesting in this book was it's discussion on the origin of traditions and customs for conflict resolution management in a decentralized system where there is no central authority. I've recently been thinking about that topic as a whole when applied to the history of the United States (and societies in general), and how such tradition and customs (deemed legitimate by the host population) were the foundations of order, and how when central authority monopolized dispensing of justice, such traditions and customs completely faded. Such things tend to completely die, with people domesticated, and left completely reliant on the central authority to properly uphold law and order, which for a variety of states across time, tends to be improperly implemented. Overall, I think that the book was very interesting and covered insightful history on the birth of the open source movement.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Man Who Solved The Market"
    author="John Steele Gordon"
    special=""
    description="This was about Jim Simons and Renaissance Technology. Simons recently passed away a few weeks before I read the book. Very interesting read. I'm surprised to have heard characters like John Nash and Claude Shannon appear throughout the book.">}}

{{< book
    title="An Empire of Wealth"
    author="John Steele Gordon"
    special=""
    description="This was a good book over the entire history of the United States, from a Marxist perspective of history (through the lens that economic structures fundamentally drives history).">}}

{{< book
    title="Writing a Compiler In Go"
    author="Thorsten Ball"
    special=""
    description="I skimmed through this book while at my sister's med school graduation. It was interesting to see how a virtual machine compiler worked. I want to make a simple compiler and interpreter over the summer, and this book will be my reference.">}}

{{< book
    title="Killers of the Flower Moon"
    author="David Grann"
    special=""
    description="This was about the Osage Murders and the birth of the FBI. Interesting to read history books and to put it in perspective with everything else. It's always strange to be reminded of prohibition. Amazing that there was ever enough political will for it to be enacted at all ever." >}}

{{< book
    title="Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"
    author="John L. Hennessy & David A. Patterson"
    special="true"
    description="Went through a bit of this for Advanced Computer Architecture. The Appendix was a great review of normal computer architecture. Good book and good class." >}}

{{< book
    title="Alexander Hamilton"
    author="Ron Chernow"
    special="true"
    description="I just found out that Ron Chernow was the author of this book that the musical was largely inspired from. Decided to give it a read, and it's my favorite of his work. Certainly a book worth reading. I realized that I knew much less about the early founding period than I previously thought." >}}

{{< book
    title="Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller"
    author="Ron Chernow"
    special=""
    description="It's always interesting to read about the original titans of the industrial age. Despite so much having changed since then, many fundamental characteristics and behaviors of humans and society seem to stay the same." >}}

{{< book
    title="Napoleon"
    author="Andrew Roberts"
    special="true"
    description="I've read dozens of books about entrepreneurs, statesmen, scientists, etc, but this book makes me feel something more than just inspiration for worldly pursuits. Napoleon was one of the last Great individuals of history. We today have an abundance great people, but long gone is the time when an era could be named after an individual alone." >}}

{{< book
    title="A Tour of C++"
    author="Bjarne Stroustrup"
    special=""
    description="I've never seen a language so great and terrible. I've yet to dive deep in a project with it. My biggest gripe about it is just the lack of decent tooling around it. I'd rather use something like Zig and Rust, where making it deployable seems like a sane task. Having to deal with the lack of coherence (tooling, package management, different versions) just makes it seem like a pain. Things like C++ supporting Modules, but 3 years later GCC still doesn't support it says it all.">}}

{{< book
    title="Efficient Go"
    author="Bartiomiej Plotka"

{{< book
    title="The House of Morgan"
    author="Ron Chernow"
    description="This behemoth of a book is about the Morgan banking dynasty, from George Peabody and J.S. Morgan to now. Because the Morgan Dynasty has been around for 200 years, this book ends up also being a nearly complete history of modern banking as a whole. What I thought was interesting was the evolution of the relation between bank and the state. From king makers to diplomats to tools of the state, their power (and power of bankers in general) has diminished greatly.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Rust Programming Language"
    author="Steve Klabnik & Carol Nichols"
    special=""
    description="This is not the first time I've read this, nor will it be the last. When I first read this two years ago, I didn't know shit from Shinola. Now, I'm marginally smarter. I've actually taken a computer architecture and OS class, understand memory, etc. I went ahead and made a few small Rust projects (a WASM blog and basic symbolic math library). Perhaps one day I'll actually use Rust for something non-trivial.">}}

{{< book
    title="The Odyssey"
    author="Translated by Emily Wilson"
    special="true"
    description="Surprisingly, I've never read many 'classics'. Emily Wilson did a fantastic translation. I did enjoy the story. These old archetypal stories always reflect aspects of the human condition that we can relate to and cause us to reflect deeper about our lives.">}}

{{< book
    title="Physics for Engineers and Scientists, Vol. 1"
    author="Hans C. Ohanian & John T. Markert"
    special="true"
    description="This is the first textbook I've actually nearly read to from cover to cover. Everything excepct for the sections on heat and thermodynamics. It was a very good textbook. I noticed that there's a really large gap in my understanding of the physical world. Math and computer science is solid knowledge, but they don't cover the physical reality around us. It's good to know those kinds of things too." >}}

{{< book
    title="Six Easy Pieces"
    author="Richard P. Feynman"
    description="Feels great to actually understand physics (currently also taking a physics sequence at UT). After a couple of books about general relativity and quantum mechanics, I'll tap out of physics. I'll have a reasonable understanding (more than I'll ever need). I can die satisfied." >}}

{{< book
    title="Rome: An Empire's Story"
    author="Greg Woolf"
    description="I loved the end, when it was talking about what causes a culture to create monuments. The late republic and early empire, tons of monuments were built. People who build monuments trust there will be people in the future to remember them. Very few monuments were built after the early life of the empire, which also lines up with the start of its decline." >}}

{{< book
    title="The Man From The Future"
    author="Ananyo Bhattacharya"
    description="This book talks about each field that John von Neumann was involved in: quantum mechanics, the manhatten project, computers, and cellular automaton. It's too late for me, but there seems to be a systematic way to raise kids with a touch of genius. Every time I think about it, focusing my entire life on gathering resources and then pivoting all my focus on my future kids seems like it should surely have a higher long term expected value than me trying to reach great heights, as my kids would surely be able to do more. Of course, the future is always full of uncertainties." >}}

{{< book
    title="American Prometheus"
    author="Kai Bird & Martin J. Sherwin"
    special="true"
    description="This is a great biography about J. Robert Oppenheimer. I've read so many books about such great figures. It's strange, going through someone's entire life in just a week. It always leaves an impression on me greatly, reading about their death, and Oppenheimer is of no exception. Wasted away from cancer. Hearing about how people change when faced with their own mortality, it always makes me stop and ponder what I am doing with my life." >}}

{{< book
    title="Einstein"
    author="Walter Isaacson"
    description="This book became so much better and more enriching after I learned about the basics of topology and the history of non-Euclidian geometry and the early Prussian university system with the characters and historic figues that came out of there. The more I understand about the world, the more beautiful things seem. Great biography in general." >}}

{{< book
    title="Algorithms to Live By"
    author="Brian Christian & Tom Griffiths"
    description="This book made me wonder how much knowledge I didn't catch throughout my life. I read a part of this book in the past before. Rereading it again, after taking computer architecture and OS, is a completely different experience. Things that I didn't understand or pick up on are now self-evident and apparent and the amount I can take away from things is greatly different." >}}

{{< book
    title="Gödel's Proof"
    author="Ernest Nagel & James R. Newman"
    special="true"
    description="For the first time in my life, I feel like I actually have a fairly intuitive understanding of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem (EDIT: forgot it already). I decided to read this because I started Gödel Escher Bach and wanted to have a good understanding the concept that inspired much of it before reading such a Tour De Force." >}}

{{< book
    title="The Joy of X"
    author="Steven Strogatz"
    description="Just another book about math history and trivia. One thing that I thought was super interesting is that it mentioned how to optimal stopping point for any problem where you know the size, the solution is 1/e. In another book, 'Agorithms To Live By', it mentioned this, but it just said .37% (the rounded decimal version of 1/e). I'm just reminded of how amazing math is and how it is unexplanably beautiful and tied together." >}}

{{< book
    title="The Creature from Jekyll Island"
    author="G. Edward Griffin"
    special="true"
    description="This is mandatory reading. This book does what Howard Zinn's 'The People's History Of The United States' wanted to do, while funnily being on the exact opposite of the political spectrum. I'm always reminded how, in response to the criticism of conspiracy theories in general, people remind us that the founding of our country was a massive conspiracy theory. The more I exist, the more I realize that a lot of the largest socio, political, and economic events in human history have all been just strings of conspiracy theories, and we are almost certainly living amongst many at the current moment." >}}

{{< book
    title="How Google Works"
    author="Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg"
    description="Bland. This was a mix between 'History of Google' and 'Google's management philosophy'. The history part is nice, the latter was just very generic stuff. Most likely my perspective. When this book came out these ideas could have been novel, but throughout the years, much of this advice propagated to most of the startups out there to the point where a lot of this is common knowledge" >}}

{{< book
    title="A Mind at Play"
    author="Rob Goodman & Jimmy Soni"
    special="true"
    description="I love Claude Shannon. Really a human to cause inspires in others. The archetypal tinkerer, just a terrific man. While I might not ever be able to outshine his genius, I might one day be able to juggle better than him (5 balls instead of 4)!" >}}

{{< book
    title="The Poincaré Conjecture"
    author="Donal O'Shea"
    special="true"
    description="A truly fantastic book, one of the best I've ever read. Goes through the history of math, from Euclid to Gauss, Riemann, etc. and covers the origin of geometry, topology, calculus, and other foundations of math and how it all connects. I very much appreciated its intro to topology as I'm very new to a lot of higher math topics. Truly a wonderful book and has helped spark a deeper curiousity and love for math within me." >}}

{{< book
    title="The Everthing Store"
    author="Brad Stone"
    special="true"
    description="This book is about Jeff Bezos and the founding of Amazon. Really surprised me. Who knows how much the lens of this story warps the reality, but from this book, it seems like Jeff Bezos doing something great was inevitable. I recently read half of 'Shoe Dog', the founding story about nike, and it really seems like the guy just got insanely lucky. Jeff Bezos seems to be at the very opposite of the spectrum; it was inevitable he would do something great. Very much holds admirable traits to emulate." >}}

{{< book
    title="All the Math You Missed"
    author="Thomas A. Garrity"
    description="This covers everything from Linear Algebra to Topology, from Differential Equations to Non-Euclidian Geometry. It was really nice to just see everything that one could cover in an undergraduate math degree and introduced me to a bunch of new topics." >}}

    description="Just had to go through this quickly to refresh my memory" >}}

{{< book
    title="Chip War"
    author="Chris Miller"
    description="This book is about the history of the microchip industry, mentioning the rise of globalism, of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the history of Silicon Valley and its relation with the US military, and the national security concerns China and the US has over the lack of control over technologies that make up the majority of their military might. Fantastic book, right down my alley." >}}

{{< book
    title="Empire of Pain"
    author="Patrick Radden Keefe"
    description="This book is about the Sackler family and the opioid pandemic. I realized that, like how a lot of women enjoy true crime stories, I am a sucker for the male equivilant: white-collar crime stories. This is like the 8th book I've read over some corporate story of fraud and greed." >}}

    title="The Smartest Guys In The Room"
    author="Bethany McLean"
    special="true"
    description="This book is about the rise and fall of Enron. It's always interesting to ready more about these interconnected web of major corporations that had a large impact on american society, mainly because we learn about these things as if they happened in a vacuum while in reality thousands of other things were going on and much of it interweaved. After reading books about Bechtel and McKinsey and seeing how those companies had a large impact on Enron and how it all feeds one another, one realizes what a complicated beast humanity is. I also just thought it's interesting seeing how historically, periods of exuberance come again and again and how our window of pattern recognition is far smaller than how often these periods occur. Problems are always ignored when the momentum of things are positive and it is only until the floor from under us begins to shake that we realize our folly. Innate suspicion is the only cure to exaulted hubris, but it's a fine line between conservatism and letting opportunities pass." >}}

Helped bring the managerial revolution to the world and now currently has the largest alumni network, with ex-McKinsey people running or holding high positions in the majority of the fortune 500 companies." >}}

{{< book
    title="The United States and the Middle East"
    author="Salim Yaqub"
    description="This is a Greats Course lecture series on Audible. I've always had a fairly deep amount of knowledge with western history but lacked historical knowledge of other cultures. The whole rise of pan-Arabism, the origin of anti-US hostility, anti-Zionism and the relation between Israel and the other states, the history of colonial european powers in the area, and the dynamic the cold war played are things I think are necessary to know to understand the last century of conflicts in this part of the world." >}}

{{< book
    title="A Beautiful Mind"
    author="Sylvia Nasar"
    description="This is a biography of the mathematician John Nash. He produced great work in multiple areas of mathematics. You have most likely heard of him from his work Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium. He suffered from Schizophrenia and lost a large chunk of his productive life due to it. Started off incredibly smart and promising, slowly lost the ability to reason, and then gained it back. By then much of his life had passed him by. He still produced work but his golden years had passed. Always reminds me to not take the time I have today for granted.">}}

Talked about the economic theories of Keynes, Friedman, Hayek, Minsky, and others, John Von Neumann and game theory, causes of market failures with natural occurring prisoner dilemmas, market spillovers, information failure, and many others, and dove into the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis.">}}

Absolutely insane that nothing happened to these guys.">}}

I think that this is her best work as it just solely inspires the creative side of man through the archetypal story of a hero who pushes through and stays true to himself and his vision despite the world saying his perception of the world is incorrect. We all sometimes doubt ourselves. We must trust our guts and persist.">}}

    description="There seems to be a trend in human history where new innovations start under a centralized institution. The internet and dozens of other innovations under the U.S. Military. Literateness used to be solely for the royal and religious sectors of society. Civilization itself, under the Egyptians, Babylonians, etc, started under a centralized power structure. As society progresses, such innovations trickle down from centralized institutions down to individuals. This book talks a lot about this past trend and tries to predict future trends from it, and most of the predictions have held out quite well.">}}

I do enjoy the talks about morality and philosophy. I've listened to the majority of content he had produced up to 2020 and have found much of the new to be a rehash of the old. I saw him give a lecture in Austin, his first public tour in a couple of years. It was all stuff I've already heard him say in the hundreds of hours I've listened to him. I feel like that's how this book felt to me.">}}

It was the fact that your habits reinforce your identity and your identity reinforces your habits. If you wake up early, you probably identify as a morning person. Because you identify as a morning person, there's much less cognitive friction in waking up early. It's just *who you are*. It's just *what you do*. Anytime I want to make a positive change in my life, I try to just become someone that does that. I want to get good at math? I'll just dive into it and *become a math guy*. Goes for anything.">}}

It's fascinating because these stories always delve into the minds of men who were thrown into unthinkable circumstances but who are quite relatable. WW2 and every war before seems as if it is from a distant time, but Vietnam, it is actually comprehensible how we went from there to now.">}}
