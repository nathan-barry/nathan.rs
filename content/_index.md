## Life

Outside of school and work, I enjoy pickleball, badminton, climbing, playing the guitar, and reading! You can see what books I've read on my [Favorite Books](/posts/favorite-books) page.

I think that the *spirit* of my life philosophy is tersely captured by the quote below, which I came across in the book [The Empire of Pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Pain).

> "I believe that a man should strive for only one thing in life, and that is to have a touch of greatness"
--- Félix Martí-Ibáñez

While the previous quote expresses the grand and aspirational, the following gives a needed dose of conscientiousness.

> "The thoughts of others\
Were light and fleeting,\
Of lovers' meeting\
Or luck or fame.\
Mine were of trouble\
And mine were steady;\
So I was ready\
When trouble came.”
<br>— A.E. Housman

There are many more pieces that I enjoy, many of which you can find on my [Favorite Quotes](/posts/favorite-quotes) page.
